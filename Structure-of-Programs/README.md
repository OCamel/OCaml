<b>The Structure of OCaml Programs</b>
Now we're going to take some time out to take a high-level look at some real OCaml programs.
I want to teach you about local and global definitions, when to use ;; vs. ;, modules, nested functions, and references. 
For this we're going to look at a lot of OCaml concepts which won't yet make sense because we haven't seen them before. 
Don't worry about the details for the moment. 
Concentrate instead on the overall shape of the programs and the features which I'll point out.
